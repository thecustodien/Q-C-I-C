### Re: What Gives?
Dear Communis,

Let me ask that again. What gives? Here we have a university, I'm sorry, let me rephrase that, a "Vishwa Vidyapeetham", that believes that they do good by the students. I respect that. Then, we have parents who believe that their decisions are for the good of their childeren as well. I respect that too. Now, let us assume that students hope to do good by themeselves. If every factor involved in this equation does what is perceived to be the good, why is the group with the largest weightage morally outraged?

They say that the the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis. Though its existance is but mere fantasy, for the sake of this argument, I say that I shalt not want to go to hell. I'm the Custodien, and I promise to look out for you all to the best of my abilities. 

Good morrow, be it friend or foe.

Regards,
The Custodien
