### What Gives?

Let me ask that again. What gives? Here we have a university, I'm sorry, let me rephrase that, a "Vishwa Vidyapeetham", that believes that they do good by the students. I respect that. Then, we have parents who believe that their decisions are for the good of their childeren as well. I respect that too. Now, let us assume that students hope to do good by themeselves. If every factor involved in this equation does what is good, why is the group with the largest weightage morally outraged?
